# Semgrep Rule Guide

Fendix's white-box engine bundles 24 Semgrep rules across four files
(auth, injection, secrets, crypto) and extracts them to a per-process
temp directory at scan time. This guide explains the metadata Fendix
expects, how rules are mapped into the Finding model, and the conventions
to follow when writing project-specific rules.

For an introduction to Semgrep itself, see the upstream
[Semgrep docs](https://semgrep.dev/docs/).

## How Fendix runs Semgrep

The Semgrep runner lives at
[`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/scanner.go`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/scanner.go)
(post-TASK-116 this is native Go, not Python). At scan time it:

1. Calls `exec.LookPath("semgrep")`. If Semgrep isn't on `$PATH`, the
   runner returns `ErrSemgrepUnavailable` and the orchestrator logs an
   "install semgrep for X% more checks" notice — the rest of the
   white-box scan continues.
2. Extracts the embedded `//go:embed rules/*.yaml` pack to a per-process
   temp directory on the first scan call.
3. Invokes `semgrep --config <rules_dir> --json --no-git-ignore --quiet
   <code_path>` with a 120-second timeout.
4. Parses the JSON output and maps each result to a Fendix `Finding` via
   `resolveSeverity`, `resolveConfidence`, `resolveCategory`,
   `resolveCWE`.

`<rules_dir>` is the temp extraction of
[`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/);
every `.yaml` file in that directory is loaded.

> **Install Semgrep for full coverage.** Without it, only the
> [AST analyzer](./checks/ast-analyzer.md) and
> [secrets scanner](./checks/secrets.md) run on the white-box side.
> Install with `pip install semgrep`.

## Rule shape

Every rule is a YAML object inside the top-level `rules:` array of a file
in `go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/`. Below is the canonical shape
Fendix expects:

```yaml
rules:
  - id: my-organisation-flask-no-csrf
    patterns:
      - pattern: |
          @$APP.route(...)
          def $FUNC(...):
              ...
      - pattern-not: |
          @csrf_protect
          def $FUNC(...):
              ...
    message: >
      Flask route '$FUNC' is missing CSRF protection.
      Wrap it with @csrf_protect or use Flask-WTF's CSRFProtect.
    languages: [python]
    severity: ERROR
    metadata:
      category: auth
      cwe: CWE-352
      confidence: HIGH
      fendix_severity: HIGH
```

The mandatory keys are the standard Semgrep ones: `id`, `patterns` (or
`pattern`), `message`, `languages`, `severity`. The `metadata` block is
where Fendix-specific information lives.

### `metadata` keys Fendix reads

| Key | Type | Required | Used to populate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `category` | string | recommended | `Finding.category` (taxonomy bucket — see below). Defaults to `whitebox` when unset. |
| `cwe` | string or list | recommended | `Finding.references` (e.g. `"CWE-89"`). Multiple CWEs may be passed as a list. |
| `confidence` | string enum | recommended | `Finding.confidence` (`HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW`). Defaults to `MEDIUM`. |
| `fendix_severity` | string enum | recommended | `Finding.severity` (`CRITICAL` / `HIGH` / `MEDIUM` / `LOW` / `INFO`). When unset, Fendix falls back to mapping Semgrep's own `severity` (`ERROR`→`HIGH`, `WARNING`→`MEDIUM`, `INFO`→`LOW`). |

### Why `fendix_severity` exists separately from `severity`

Semgrep's `severity` (`ERROR`/`WARNING`/`INFO`) describes how the rule
behaves in Semgrep's own UI — it's primarily a CI-failure signal. Fendix's
severity scale has five buckets and is tied to a numeric scoring formula
(see [`docs/adr/ADR-003-severity-scoring.md`](./adr/ADR-003-severity-scoring.md)).
The two scales don't map cleanly. `fendix_severity` lets a rule say "I'm
a Semgrep `ERROR` for CI gating, but in Fendix's vocabulary I'm a
`CRITICAL`" — JWT bypass is the canonical example.

---

## Categories

Pick the closest category from this list. Mapping to a known category
ensures the finding is grouped correctly in the report and counted in the
right summary bucket.

| Category | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `auth_bypass` | Missing or bypassable authentication, `verify=False` JWT, `alg:none`. |
| `injection` | SQL, command, LDAP, XPath injection patterns. |
| `secrets` | Hardcoded credentials, API keys, certificates, weak crypto for password storage. |
| `idor` | Direct object references that don't enforce ownership. |
| `data_exposure` | Sensitive data in responses, logs, error messages. |
| `cors` | Permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, credential leakage. |
| `headers` | Missing or weak security headers. |
| `info_disclosure` | Stack traces, version banners, internal paths. |
| `auth` | Auth-related findings that aren't full bypasses (missing decorator, weak session config). |

Unrecognised categories pass through unchanged but won't be counted in the
sources/severity summary correctly.

---

## Severity guidance

Use `fendix_severity` consistently with the project's scoring model:

- **`CRITICAL`** — directly exploitable on its own. Hardcoded production
  credential. JWT signature verification disabled. SQL injection in a
  string-format query. Reserve for "fix this before lunch."
- **`HIGH`** — exploitable with a precondition or access. SSRF on a
  non-public endpoint. Missing auth on a sensitive route.
- **`MEDIUM`** — defence-in-depth violation, or a heuristic with real
  false-positive risk. Open-redirect candidates. Permissive CORS without
  credentials. Pattern-only matches that need eyeballs.
- **`LOW`** — informational with mild impact. Non-secret hardcoded
  identifier. Out-of-date dependency without a known CVE.
- **`INFO`** — diagnostic only. Reserve for rules you want in the report
  but never want a `--fail-on` to fire on.

Fendix enforces a consistency rule: a finding with `confidence: LOW`
cannot have `severity` higher than `MEDIUM`. The orchestrator will
downgrade and warn. Tune `confidence` to match the rule's true precision —
don't over-claim `HIGH` for pattern matches that have known false positives.

> **Since v2.0, severity alone will not fail a build from a semgrep rule.** The
> semgrep-shim tier is excluded from the `deterministic detection` confidence
> bonus — it is a documented false-positive class — so a shape-match finding
> scores `35 base + 10 static − 5 tier = 40`, lands in the `MEDIUM` band (which
> starts at 40), and with no corroborating signal is held at `WARN` rather than
> `BLOCK`. **A semgrep HIGH
> with no taint chain no longer gates on its own.** What lifts one back to
> blocking is corroboration: a proven taint path, a confirmed route, or
> cross-engine agreement with the live scan. `--enforce-confidence=false`
> restores the pre-2.0 severity-only gate for the whole scan, but that is a
> blunt instrument — prefer writing rules whose findings can be corroborated.

## Worked examples

### Auth — JWT decoded without signature verification

Source: [`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/auth.yaml`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/auth.yaml)

```yaml
- id: python-jwt-decode-no-verification
  patterns:
    - pattern: jwt.decode($TOKEN, options={"verify_signature": False, ...}, ...)
    - pattern: jwt.decode($TOKEN, algorithms=["none"], ...)
  message: >
    JWT decoded with signature verification disabled.
    This allows an attacker to forge tokens.
    Remove options={"verify_signature": False} and specify a strong algorithm.
  languages: [python]
  severity: ERROR
  metadata:
    category: auth
    cwe: CWE-347
    confidence: HIGH
    fendix_severity: CRITICAL
```

Why it's CRITICAL: a rule that triggers means an attacker can forge any
token. There's no second precondition.

### Injection — SQL via string formatting

Source: [`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/injection.yaml`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/injection.yaml)

```yaml
- id: python-sql-injection-string-format
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        $CURSOR.execute("..." % ...)
    - pattern: |
        $CURSOR.execute("..." + ...)
    - pattern: |
        $CURSOR.execute(f"...{$VAR}...")
  message: >
    SQL query built via string formatting — SQL injection risk.
    Use parameterized queries: cursor.execute("SELECT ... WHERE x = %s", (value,))
  languages: [python]
  severity: ERROR
  metadata:
    category: injection
    cwe: CWE-89
    confidence: HIGH
    fendix_severity: CRITICAL
```

### Secrets — hardcoded password / key assignment

Source: [`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/secrets.yaml`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/secrets.yaml)

```yaml
- id: python-hardcoded-secret-assignment
  patterns:
    - pattern: $KEY = "$VALUE"
    - metavariable-regex:
        metavariable: $KEY
        regex: (?i)(password|passwd|pwd|secret|api_key|apikey|auth_token|access_token|client_secret|private_key)
    - metavariable-regex:
        metavariable: $VALUE
        regex: .{6,}
  pattern-not: $KEY = ""
  message: >
    Hardcoded secret found in assignment to '$KEY'.
    Move secrets to environment variables or a secrets manager.
    Rotate the exposed credential immediately.
  languages: [python]
  severity: ERROR
  metadata:
    category: secrets
    cwe: CWE-798
    confidence: HIGH
    fendix_severity: CRITICAL
```

`pattern-not: $KEY = ""` excludes the empty-string idiom that often
appears in placeholder code. Use `pattern-not` aggressively — false
positives erode trust faster than missed findings.

## Writing your own rule

1. **Find the smallest pattern that matches your concern.** A two-line
   pattern is easier to maintain than a 20-line one.
2. **Add `pattern-not` for known-good idioms.** Skim a real codebase for
   the patterns you'd never want to flag, then add a `pattern-not` for
   each.
3. **Pick `confidence` honestly.** If your rule's pattern matches more
   than the actual issue, downgrade to `MEDIUM` or `LOW`.
4. **Audit the rule pack.** Sprint 18 added a YAML-only catalog test at
   [`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/scanner_rulepack_test.go`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/scanner_rulepack_test.go)
   that asserts every rule carries `metadata.category`,
   `metadata.fendix_severity`, `metadata.confidence`, and
   `metadata.cwe`, and that no two rules share an `id`. When you add a
   rule, bump `rulepackTotalCount` in the same commit so the count
   assertion stays green.
5. **Run the suite locally.**

   ```bash
   make test                                            # full suite
   cd go && go test ./internal/scanner/semgrep/...      # just the Semgrep package
   ```

6. **Verify the rule resolves cleanly.** Semgrep itself will warn on
   pattern syntax errors:

   ```bash
   semgrep --config go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/ --validate
   ```

   The `TestRulepack_ValidatesViaSemgrepCLI` test runs this
   automatically when `semgrep` is on `$PATH`; it skips otherwise so
   contributors without semgrep installed aren't blocked.

### Project-local rule files

The Fendix engine runs Semgrep against the rules directory bundled inside
the binary. To use project-specific rules today, layer them in by either
(a) running Semgrep directly alongside Fendix and folding the JSON results
into your CI report, or (b) building Fendix from source with your rule
files added to `go/internal/scanner/semgrep/rules/`.

A `--semgrep-rules` flag for layering external rule directories at scan
time is on the backlog — track progress in the GitHub issue tracker.

## Mapping reference (cheat sheet)

| Semgrep result | → | Fendix Finding field |
|---|---|---|
| `metadata.category` | → | `category` |
| `metadata.cwe` | → | `references[]` |
| `metadata.confidence` | → | `confidence` |
| `metadata.fendix_severity` | → | `severity` |
| `extra.severity` (fallback) | → | `severity` (mapped: ERROR→HIGH, WARNING→MEDIUM, INFO→LOW) |
| `check_id` | → | `title` |
| `extra.message` | → | `evidence` (truncated to 200 chars) |
| `path` + `start.line` | → | `endpoint`, `line` ("path:line") |

See [`go/internal/scanner/semgrep/scanner.go`](../go/internal/scanner/semgrep/scanner.go)
for the implementation.
