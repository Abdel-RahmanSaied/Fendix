// ── Capture-time redaction ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Credential material is replaced HERE, in the scanner, before an
// evidence.Evidence is ever constructed. Redacting at render time would be
// too late: Finding.Evidence is read verbatim by the JSON, SARIF, HTML and
// PDF reporters, by internal/ghapp (which posts scan JSON into GitHub PR
// comments) and by internal/integrations/jira (which pastes it into a ticket
// body). reporters/sanitize.go only knows about the scan's own AuthContext —
// it has no idea what the secrets scanner just discovered — so the ONLY place
// that can guarantee a secret never leaves the process is the capture site.
//
// The invariant the rest of this file exists to uphold: the raw source line
// is used for offsets, pattern matching and placeholder classification, and
// for NOTHING else. The only string allowed to reach an Evidence is the
// redacted one.

// redactionMarker renders credential material as a non-reversible stand-in.
//
// Deterministic with no salt (Constitution Rule 8): identical values always
// produce identical markers, so evidence bytes are reproducible across runs
// and the dedup primary-selection tiebreak (engine.findingLess compares
// Evidence) stays stable.
//
// `len` is the BYTE length of the value; the digest is the first 4 bytes
// (8 hex chars) of its SHA-256, which is enough for a human to recognise two
// occurrences of the same credential without carrying the credential. It is a
// FINGERPRINT, not a security boundary — a low-entropy value like `hunter2`
// is trivially recoverable from it by dictionary — so never describe it to
// users as "the secret cannot be recovered".

// participate.

// those rules match an `AKIA…` literal in Go/JS source and, before this
// existed, emitted the raw source line as evidence — so a live AWS key reached
// Finding.Evidence verbatim and travelled from there into SARIF, HTML, Jira
// tickets and GitHub PR comments. FIX-13 redacted this package's own scanner
// and missed that one.
//
// One format matters more than it looks: the marker embeds a length and a
// digest so a human can tell two occurrences of the same credential apart, and
