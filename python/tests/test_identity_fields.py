"""Every Python-emitted finding must carry the identity the v2 fingerprint keys on.

The end-to-end baseline experiment caught what the Go unit corpus could not:
the Python dependency analyzer emits findings with no rule_id and no
dependency block, so four different CVEs across three different packages
collapsed into ONE identity —

    cat=deps + manifest=requirements.txt

and nothing else. Suppressing one of those findings would have suppressed all
four, silently. Identity can only key on what the emitter actually sends.
