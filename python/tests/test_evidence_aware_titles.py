"""RC-6: a finding's title must never claim evidence stronger than it holds.

The analyzer already knows the difference — it downgrades confidence when a
reachability-dependent sink has no proven source->sink path — but the title is
passed in as one fixed string, so the same words are printed either way. A
chainless path-traversal match therefore reported "user input flows to
filesystem path" while asserting nothing of the kind, and a PROVEN SSRF
reported "Potential SSRF" while holding a complete taint chain.

The invariant under test: the wording of a finding is a function of the
evidence that finding carries.
